# Code Smells Kata

**Smelly Tic Tac Toe**

We created a very smelly implementation of TicTacToe. There are quite a few code smells in the implementation: 


* Feature envy
* Data class
* Message chain
* Divergent change
* Data clump
* Lazy class

had a go at:
* Long parameter list
* Shotgun surgery
* Primitive obsession
* Large class
* Duplicated code
* Dead code
* Comments
* Long method

Start by identifying the smells and then slowly refactor the code. Remember to keep the tests passing at all times during the refactor. It's ok to revert back to a previous working state at any moment.
